        <h2>Tesla Bio:</h2>

        <p class="bio-para">
          Born and raised in the Austrian Empire, Tesla received an advanced
          education in engineering and physics in the 1870s and gained practical
          experience in the early 1880s working in telephony and at Continental
          Edison in the new electric power industry. He emigrated to the United
          States in 1884, where he would become a naturalized citizen. He worked
          for a short time at the Edison Machine Works in New York City before
          he struck out on his own. With the help of partners to finance and
          market his ideas, Tesla set up laboratories and companies in New York
          to develop a range of electrical and mechanical devices. His
          alternating current (AC) induction motor and related polyphase AC
          patents, licensed by Westinghouse Electric in 1888, earned him a
          considerable amount of money and became the cornerstone of the
          polyphase system which that company would eventually market.
        </p>

        <p class="bio-para">
          Attempting to develop inventions he could patent and market, Tesla
          conducted a range of experiments with mechanical
          oscillators/generators, electrical discharge tubes, and early X-ray
          imaging. He also built a wireless-controlled boat, one of the first
          ever exhibited. Tesla became well known as an inventor and would
          demonstrate his achievements to celebrities and wealthy patrons at his
          lab, and was noted for his showmanship at public lectures.
        </p>

        <p class="bio-para">
          Throughout the 1890s, Tesla would pursue his ideas for wireless
          lighting and worldwide wireless electric power distribution in his
          high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and
          Colorado Springs. In 1893, he made pronouncements on the possibility
          of wireless communication with his devices. Tesla tried to put these
          ideas to practical use in his unfinished Wardenclyffe Tower project,
          an intercontinental wireless communication and power transmitter, but
          ran out of funding before he could complete it.

              <p class="list-para">
                Chances are that you have already seen this invention. It is a
                transformer used to produce high-voltage, low-current,
                high-frequency alternating-current electricity. To observers, it
                appears as if lightning is being shot into the air. A Tesla coil
                consists of a primary coil and a secondary coil, each with its
                own capacitor to store electrical energy. The two coils and
                capacitors are connected by a spark gap. A high-voltage source
                powers the system. The primary coil’s capacitor eventually
                builds up so much charge that it breaks down the air resistance
                in the spark gap. Then, the current flows out of the capacitor
                down the primary coil and creates a magnetic field. This field
                collapses quickly and generates an electric current in the
                secondary coil. The voltage zipping through the air between the
                two coils creates sparks in the gap and, eventually, the charge
                in the secondary capacitor becomes so high that it breaks free
                in a spectacular burst of electric current. The resulting
                high-frequency voltage can illuminate fluorescent bulbs several
                feet away with no wire connection

              <p class="list-para">
                Tesla had intended the Tesla Coil to be part of a wireless power
                system and was a mainstay of many of Tesla’s other experiments.
                By running a wire connected to the resonator around his lab he
                permeated his lab with electromagnetic energy and was able to
                light a fluorescent bulb held in his hand because the voltage
                drop through the air was great enough to cause a sufficient
                current flow. Using a magnifying transmitter, he was also
                reportedly able to light a field of bulbs at a distance of 1 km.
                The magnifying transmitter was an adaptation of the Tesla coil,
                only instead of discharging to the earth, the magnifying
                transmitter created standing waves of electrical energy, which
                could be harnessed by a tuned receiving circuit.

                Tesla saw the rise of the piston engine in the automobile
                industry as a way to make a change in the world. He developed
                his own turbine-style engine that used combustion to make disks
                rotate. The fuel efficiency of his engine was as high as 90%, a
                big achievement considering this is similar to the efficiency of
                some modern turbines.

                While Rontgen has been credited with developing the first X-ray
                films, called shadowgraphs, there is clear evidence that Tesla
                was also working in this area. The problem is that Tesla lost a
                lot of his work due to a fire in his lab. Nikola Tesla may well
                have produced the first X-ray image in the United States when he
                attempted to use a vacuum tube to obtain an image of Mark Twain.
                However, instead of Twain, the resulting image showed the screw
                for adjusting the camera lens. He did later obtain shadowgraph
                images of the human body, shortly after Roentgen published his
                discovery on November 8, 1895. Tesla also described some
                clinical benefits of X-rays.

              <p class="list-para">
                Guglielmo Marconi was initially credited, and most believe him
                to be the inventor of radio to this day. However, the Supreme
                Court overturned Marconi’s patent in 1943, when it was proven
                that Tesla invented the radio years previous to Marconi. Radio
                signals are just another frequency that needs a transmitter and
                receiver, which Tesla also demonstrated in 1893 during a
                presentation before The National Electric Light Association. In
                1897 Tesla applied for two patents US 645576, and US 649621. In
                1904, however, The U.S. Patent Office reversed its decision,
                awarding Marconi a patent for the invention of radio, possibly
                influenced by Marconi’s financial backers in the States, who
                included Thomas Edison and Andrew Carnegie. This also allowed
                the U.S. government (among others) to avoid having to pay the
                royalties that were being claimed by Nikola Tesla.

              <p class="list-para">
                Alternating current is considered Tesla’s crowning achievement.
                While not the inventor of AC power, he made it easy to use
                widely. AC power allows for electricity to be sent over long
                distances much more efficiently. Westinghouse bought Tesla’s AC
                patents and used them to bid on the lighting of the Chicago
                World’s Fair. They won the contract and were able to provide
                power at around $150,000, which is less than it would have cost
                to provide power using direct current. That’s a wrap, as they
                say. Tesla’s apparent innate skill for invention and
                unfathomable imagination made him one of the most prolific
                inventors of our age. While we have selected but a few of his
                many inventions, it is clear that his genius was unparalleled in
                his time, and perhaps ours.
